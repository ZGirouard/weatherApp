weather.py and weather_interface.py
Written by Zach Girouard

Simple weather program that scrapes data from a google search and outputs it in a simple interface. This is a work-in-progress project and still has occasionally issues with scraping web pages. Additionally, I'm looking to update the graphics for the interface at a later time and possible use a different medium other than Python's canvas. This project was not created as part of a class at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.
